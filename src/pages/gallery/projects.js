The site is small — 800 m2 (0.08 ha). Because of this, the house has an introverted mood - it is not visible from the street. The customer wanted a three bedrooms house with a parking lot, a utility block, an outdoor swimming pool, a summer living room with a fireplace and a large terrace. In order to accommodate so many zones with different functions, not clutter up the site and orient the windows of all important rooms to the south, we moved the house to the far border of the site.",
